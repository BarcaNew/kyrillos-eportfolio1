          Creating my website using Wix provided me with a good display of my abilities and knowledge in that topic. It shows my skills in web design, efficient communication, and digital literacy. 
          This artifact demonstrates my willingness to use modern technology for building a website or using technology in general for unique purposes, which is a skill that is becoming increasingly 
          important in today's digital world and will help in the future. It shows my ability to create a user-friendly, pleasing, and functional website which is a nice thing to know. 
          This assignment reflected and helped me to know some of the Catholic Graduate Expectations. I was able to communicate my ideas and information through the website and through presenting 
          it to the class, and this represents the effective communicator skill. For the reflective, creative, and holistic thinker, I used this to think strategically, creatively, and holistically
          while making my website because I had to consider various visual elements and the elements of a website too.For being a self-directed, responsible, lifelong learner, I worked through the 
          challenges of creating a website for the first time while learning new things along the way.Finally, I was a responsible citizen when using technology and a collaborative contributor by 
          building a website that is accessible to and used by others you may want to see it.

        <br>
        <br><p>The Bing search engine project reflects my skills and understanding regarding looking at different technology and research. With this project, I was able to learn about the a well known search engine, as well as how 
          it evolved and what technology was used to make it possible. It demonstrates my ability to learn knowledge, and communicate it professionally through a slideshow. In terms of Catholic Graduate Expectations, it helped 
          me with some of them too. As a discerning believer, I was able to understand and be thankful for technology and how it affects our daily lives. I was able to communicate cool ideas in a friendly manner as an effective 
          communicator. Throughout the research process, I had to be a reflective, creative, and holistic thinker as I explored many things about Bing such as the evolution and significance of the search engine. As a self-directed, 
          responsible, lifelong learner, I researched the topic thoroughly and gained knowledge about this of search engine.  Finally, I was a responsible citizen and collaborative contributor by sharing what I learned and using 
          skills of the digital world.

          organize and run online conferences and meetings, as well as record them and use the different features, which is an essential skill in the future because technology is becoming more and more useful. In any business setting 
          where they use remote communication, this would be a good thing to know and will benefit me. This project fits with the Catholic Graduate Expectations' requirements for becoming a responsible citizen in the digital age, an 
          effective communicator, and a collaborative contributor. I showed I was an effective communicator because I could use digital tools to successfully communicate ideas and information by setting up and running a Skype meeting.

          as a digital citizen by utilizing Skype in a responsible manner.

       <br><p>This project demonstrates my ability of presenting my knowledge and research of  my understanding of academic honesty and the affects of plagiarism. It shows that I should always be working towards creativity and look for 
          appreciation for the work of others. To follow the rules of many places like schools and work, this knowledge is essential in professional as well as academic settings. Being a responsible citizen, a self-directed, responsible, 
          lifelong learner, and a perceptive believer are all in line with this task. This helped me to show the expectation of a discerning believer as I showed my dedication to my Catholic faith's values of honesty and being truthful by 
          making a slideshow about the information I learned from research and in class about plagiarism. I was a self-directed, responsible, lifelong learner as I showed my dedication to lifelong learning and being responsible for my own 
          education by researching further about the idea of plagiarism for this project. Lastly, I was a responsible citizen because I was responsible by teaching others about plagiarism and creating an environment of academic honesty.</p>

        <br><p>In the Google Sheets Payroll assessment, I demonstrated my skills with spreadsheet software like google sheets and excel, calculations using formulas learned in class, and data management. This project shows my knowledge 
          to deal with different pieces of data, doing correct calculations, and presenting data in an understandable manner for others to see and this will be very useful in future careers when managing a team, running a company, or 
          working in jobs that involve finance. This assignment also reflects some Catholic graduate expectations. I was an effective communicator as I clearly and simply presented important payroll data into an easy to understand spreadsheet.  
          I was a reflective, creative, and holistic thinker because I made decisions and found solutions by thinking about which formulas to use and how to organize my data. I was a self-directed, accountable, lifelong learner because I 
          successfully completed my spreadsheet payroll by implementing all knowledge gained in class. </p>

        <br><p>In the computer parts project, I learned many new things about the computer which I never knew about as we thought the computer was a simple piece of technology tht we sued but it turns out its way more than I
           expected and how technology is developing both physically and inside of the computer. I was able to demonstrate my understanding by research and class learning of computer hardware and software with this project. 
           In the world of technology, even having a basic understanding of computer components is important because this information can be used to identify problems with our computer. I was also able to show through this 
           project some graduate expectations as well as the project reflecting them too. I was a reflective, creative, and holistic thinker because when understood the different computer components, I had to consider how various 
           elements work together to produce a functional computer. I reflected a self-directed, responsible, lifelong learner as I had to show that I could manage my own learning by studying about computer hardware for this assignment 
           and to apply my knowledge here so that I may refer back to it when I need it in the future such as studying for my exam or in the real world. Lastly, I was an effective communicator when  I presented to my class and the teacher 
           the information I learned at that time and moving forward.</p>

        <br><p>In the Googley company project, this helped me to put my knowledge and abilities to use by having me visualize the responsibilities of being a business owner such as creating all the perks, the brochure with the information 
          for hiring employyees, finding good ergonomics for staff, creating and gaining knowledge on how to write properly formatted business letters, and much more. It demonstrates my understanding of the planning process and business operations. 
          Any company environment will benefit greatly from this knowledge so having this experience is really good. For the Googley project, it also helped me to show some Catholic graduate expectations. I was a reflective, creative, and holistic 
          thinker which is a major one in this project because I has to consider the responsibilities  of what it would be like to create a business and things similar to this in the real world which would benefit me by having this familiarity. I
           was a caring family member as I had to consider what what best for the company and planning for our employees like ergonomics. Lastly, I was a responsible citizen because I showed that I understood my responsibility of planning properly
            while being in control of my time management too.</p>
